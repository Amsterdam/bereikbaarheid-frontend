# By default, Compose reads two files, a docker-compose.yml and an
# optional docker-compose.override.yml file. By convention,
# the docker-compose.yml contains your base configuration. The
# override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration
# overrides for existing services or entirely new services.
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/
#
# Usage: copy this file, name it ".docker-compose.override.yml" and
# set your own values.
